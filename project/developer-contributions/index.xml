      <description>This page documents the alpha phase for developing a format for representing developer contributions as data.
You can help us improve the format by:
 participating in the discussion on our GitHub issues making comments using our feedback form  We will continue to develop the format as we learn from testing the format with data and the prototypes with users.
We would particularly like to hear from local planning authorities who are able to make their developer contributions public and would be willing to participate in our user research.</description>
